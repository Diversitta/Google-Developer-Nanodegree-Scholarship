> Hi! Do we need to resubmit the projects we have already completed to our mentors? The first deadline is said to be on the 1st March but I don't see the what I need to do now - unless sending to my mentor the already completed apps (android development course) thanks!

hey @Szilvita, good question. You need to submit your projects for review in your classroom, the deadlines are there to help you pace your own learning experience. It is important to remember that deadlines are met when a project is submitted, reviewed and deemed as *passed*.

> Hello, is there somewhere where you list all the deadline dates on the abnd course within the 6 months so we can arrange our own timeline?

Hi @JuliaP not yet but soon – all the deadlines (for all tracks) will be listed early next week in the Updates section of our google site https://sites.google.com/knowlabs.com/gdnd2017/updates. So please check it regularly, we will be posting there news and updates almost every day!
