> Hi! Do we need to resubmit the projects we have already completed to our mentors? The first deadline is said to be on the 1st March but I don't see the what I need to do now - unless sending to my mentor the already completed apps (android development course) thanks!

Good question. You need to submit your projects for review in your classroom, the deadlines are there to help you pace your own learning experience. It is important to remember that deadlines are met when a project is submitted, reviewed and deemed as *passed*.

> Hello, is there somewhere where you list all the deadline dates on the abnd course within the 6 months so we can arrange our own timeline?

Not yet but soon – all the deadlines (for all tracks) will be listed early next week in the Updates section of our google site https://sites.google.com/knowlabs.com/gdnd2017/updates. So please check it regularly, we will be posting there news and updates almost every day!

> Hi, you advise us to post projects 2 weeks before the deadline, but, in the Android developer track, the first project is due in only one week! Is that okay?

Yes, just try and submit it as soon as possible, to give the reviewers enough time to check it.

> If a my submission is not passed, what's happen? Can I correct it and submit again?`

Hi Federico! In case your submission is not passed, you can try to improve it and submit it again. In general there are no limits, and you can try as many time as you want, however, we recommend you always to be mindful when you do that – reviewers need between 1-2 weeks to review your work, so every time you submit it, please make sure this is the best version that you have. It’s always recommended to reach out to community and mentors for feedback before you decided to submit your work. Good luck!
